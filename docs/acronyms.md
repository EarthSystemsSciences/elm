ELM = Earth Land Model. It is part of E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model - DOEâ€™s global climate model. Other agencies have their own versions).

ARM = Atmospheric Radiation Monitoring. It is a very large DOE funded program which takes a lot of different measurements of the atmosphere for multiple purposes.

ESGF = Earth System Grid Federation. It stores and shares model output data as well as some relevant observational (input or comparison) data.
